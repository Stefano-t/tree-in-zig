# tree in Zig

Simple implementation of the `tree` UNIX command line utility in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)

## About this project

This is just a toy project to explore the Zig programming language. This is NOT
a good example of how to write good Zig code and it doesn't pretend to be like
so.

## How to build this project

Make sure to install the Zig compiler. This code was developed using the
`0.10.1` version. Once Zig is installed and accessible from your `PATH`, run

```bash
# build the project
$ zig build
# run the executable
$ zig-out/bin/zree <path to your directory>
```
